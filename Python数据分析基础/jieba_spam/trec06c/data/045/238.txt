     Postdoctoral and Research Associate Positions in Computational Bio-imaging Informatics
     We seek outstanding candidates for postdoctoral research and research associate positions in a NIH granted computational bio-imaging informatics project. The candidates are expected to have a strong background on imaging processing, signal processing and data modeling. The candidates must be a team player with extensive knowledge in bioinformatics and computational biology; good understanding of light or optical microscopy imaging techniques is a plus. Research involves bioinformatics, high thr: oughput cell imaging, and in vivo molecular imaging. The successful candidates are expected to work at Harvard University for three years.
