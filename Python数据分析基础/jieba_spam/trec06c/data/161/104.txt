Title:
A Novel Concept of Forwardlink Channel Estimation and Precoding
in Wireless Communications based on Decimated Feedback
Abstract
Wireless communication systems often encounter various types of
channel conditions that lead to different channel capacities. It is
well known that capacity-approaching performance requires transmitter
knowledge of the forwardlink channel state information (CSI). How
to acquire this important CSI at the transmitter is a major challenge.
Here, we provide a new channel estimation paradigm for duplex
wireless links. We describe a power and bandwidth efficient dual channel
identification scheme based on decimated signal feedback for duplex
wireless communication systems.  Instead of estimating and feeding back
channel parameters, the mobile station returns a portion of its received
data back to the base station for channel identification.  We also
demonstrate the integration of precoded transmission into duplex channel
estimation mechanism based on bent-pipe signal feedback under multipath
channel distortions. We present an effective fractionally-spaced
precoder design based on the base-station transmitter estimation of the
downlink channel.  We focus on feedback of fractionally spaced samples
and demonstrate the significant improvement when the channel estimator
is given access to the precoder filters used by the wireless
transmitters. We extend this new framework to discrete multitone (DMT)
modulation and illustrate the effectiveness of the forward channel
estimation on bitloading in DMT systems.
